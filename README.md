# Modeling fires propagation
This 6-parameters model describe the spreading of vegetation on a 2-dimensional lattice with nearest neighbors connectivity. On top of the vegetation, fires can spread. A number of approximations can be implemented as well, for instance time-scale separation or a simpler mean-field model. An exact stochastic simulation can be achieved using a spatially explicit version of the Gillespie algorithm.
